## The Dark Side of DevOps

For the last decade, our industry has been staring at the complex, interwoven landscape of delivery on the cloud-native frontier calling it “DevOps.” It came bearing promises of broken-down silos, of increased agility, a rethinking of the whole SDLC. When you peel back the hype and the promises though, what you find underneath is the dark truth that the term has been obfuscating all this while. The inconvenient truth is that stable, secure, and scalable systems are full of unique complexities all their own and the understanding of those complexities has always lived under a different hat. It’s all operations, always has been.

### The Philosophy Was Right, The Implementation Was Flawed

Let’s be clear: the philosophy of DevOps is vital, it’s the realization that’s been lacking. The ideas that it has brought to the table and made central to the discussion of how we produce and deliver software are invaluable. They’re real solutions to real problems. Tightening the loop between development and deployment, automating away toil, focusing on the repeatable-not the one off, all of these are important and useful things. Notably, however, none of them are the actions of an individual. They’re results of process, of interrelation, they’re the result of a philosophy, not of a job title.

When the idea of DevOps as a job title caught on it came with the realization that it would need to be coupled with responsibilities and actionable objectives. The industry found two roads forward. For some, DevOps would mean embracing “you build it, you run it”, tasking developers with the totality of the lifecycle of their application. For others, it would mean taking administrators out of the datacenter and putting them on the cloud. In the former case, developers were asked to adopt a whole new discipline as their own; they were to wear two hats full time and get more done as a result. Instead, they faced record levels of burn out and endless distractions from their developmental focus. In the latter, the administrators were given a new context and a new toolset, but the fundamental nature of their job didn’t change. Unsurprisingly, this is the model that has flourished: skilled administrators now able to realize architecture without the pain of physical procurement.

### The True Cost of Negligence

Time and experience have shown us that trying to merge development and operations into a single role was a fundamentally flawed idea from its inception. You should no more ask a developer to build infrastructure than you’d ask an architect to do your plumbing, or for a paralegal to litigate your case. The two are clearly deeply coupled fields, but trying to unify them has only led to the true dark side of DevOps: a systemic and pervasive negligence. A negligence that has taken root in the fertile ground of an industry still besotted with the idea that software is fundamentally different from other fields of engineering. It is not. The “move fast and break things” mantra has become an omnipresent excuse to ignore the foundational principles of sound engineering that govern other disciplines. In its wake, we find ourselves faced with consequences that were only all too predictable: **ever mounting technical debt, ballooning cloud spend, and burnt-out engineers.**

### Enter Platform Engineering: Operations Reimagined

This is why the rise of **Platform Engineering** has felt like such a breath of fresh air—not because it’s a new field, but because it’s an honest and proper realization of an old one. It’s an admission that operations is a discrete specialty in its own right and that the problem with it historically wasn’t its existence, but rather its interface with development. It’s the true face of system administration in a cloud-native era finally seeing the light of day. By presenting developers with a unified and codified portal into the realm of operations, both sides find themselves freed of burdens that have far outstayed their welcome. Administrators no longer contend with infinitely variable application requirements, and developers are freed from the complexities of running secure, performant systems. Instead, a frictionless handshake at a well-defined API creates a connection where both sides can work in the original spirit of DevOps.

The realization of DevOps through Platform Engineering is the first sign of a welcoming of broader engineering principles into the software world. It recognizes that whether you’re designing a bridge, building a chemical plant, or architecting a webapp, they’re all defined by their requirements, their interfaces, and their interconnectivity. A platform team builds the factory so that the development team can see the product realized as seamlessly as possible within it. This well-defined interface creates an environment where the true philosophy of collaboration that underpins DevOps is able to thrive.

### A Mature Future for Software

When you see a successful, high-functioning product organization, take a closer look. You won’t see developers drowning in operational toil. You won’t see administrators pulling out their hair at ever-evolving environments. You’ll see a robust platform providing easily consumable services with well-defined uses and integrations. You’ll see the discipline of operations given room to breathe as administrators build to meet organizational needs, not just product-specific ones. You’ll realize the truth that’s been there all along, what we’re seeing isn’t a novelty, it’s an inevitability.

**DevOps is dead, long live Platform Engineering.**
