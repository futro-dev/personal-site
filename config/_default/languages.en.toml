  bio = "My focus is on architecting long-term, holistic solutions to complex, systemic problems. I build systems that treat developer experience as a primary feature and don't neglect the position that they fill in the broader ecosystem. I believe the most elegant platforms are those that don't just meet a business need, but also reduce the externalities that interfere with developers and administrators-empowering them to do their best work. Taking a first-principles, from the ground up approach means I build infrastructure that is inherently resilient, secure, and built to last."
